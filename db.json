I had always been in awe of people who could program. It seemed that they had the potential to create worlds; worlds that were only limited by their own creativity and imagination.

It seemed that everyone I knew had heard of this term and everyone had experience with it. My first experience with a CMS came from a class mate that needed help with a few of his clients. He approached me and asked if I would be willing to help update a few sites with new content several times a week. Being very comfortable with HTML and CSS, I was happy to help. Initially, this freelance was a combination of HTML and CMS work, but soon it started to include modifying PHP code that controlled layouts and basic functionality. \n\nAfter many attempts I could usually find and modify the code that needed updating. However, every bit of programming I had to do made my brain hurt and left me feeling massively overwhelmed. I simply didn't understand how to program.

This constant nagging that I'll never know enough or never be as good as so and so. \n\nDespite these feelings, I've realized that programming is constantly changing.
